abstract: Data portals mainly publish semi-structured, tabular formats which lack semantic descriptions of geo-entities and therefore, do not allow any exploration and automated visualization of these datasets. Herein, we present a framework to add geo-semantic labels, based on a constructed geo-entity knowledge graph, and a user interface to query and automatically visualize the resources from the Austrian data portals. The web-application is available at https://reboting.com/ .

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: An interface that allows geo-queries for Austrian federal states and automatically generates visualization of respective open datasets. The geo-labelling of the dataset is based on a base knowledge graph of geo-entities..
